## request - response cycle ##
  app recieves a request for which it will then
  create a res/req object

In order to process data middlewear is used
can manipulate the req/res objects
(in express everything is middleware)

## MIDDLEWARE STACK ##
  order is defined by order of appearance in code
  order matters alot in express

  * When creating custom middleware, one must always call the next() function
  // EXAMPLE
  app.use((req, res, next) => {
    // code
    next();
  })

  middleware without any routing specified will
  be applied to each and every request

  global middleware at top of file!
